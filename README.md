- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is the first project I made with theme color switcher. I was quite challenging but after trying diferents methods I was able to make it functional. In addition to this, it was the first time to me making a filter and a search input. This was the most challenging part of the project. After some errors I could pulled it through and it is fully functional. 

### Continued development

I am currently learning Next JS and I am hoping to make my firs app in this technology really soon. Also, I want to learn Tailwing since it will help me a lot with styling doing it faster and better. After learning Next, I will learn Node JS to become a Full Stack Developer. That is my final goal. That is what I want the most.
